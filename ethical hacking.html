<strong>White hat hacker:-</strong>
A hacker can be a wiz kid who spends too much time with computers and suddenly finds himself submerged in the world of cyber-security or criminal conspirators. On the other hand, he can be a master criminal who wants to obtain huge amounts of money for him, or even worse, dominate the world.

<br></font> <strong>Grey Hat Hackers:-</strong>
A grey hat hacker is someone who is in between these two concepts. He may use his skills for legal or illegal acts, but not for personal gains. Grey hackers use their skills in order to prove themselves that they can accomplish a determined feat, but never do it in order to make money out of it. The moment they cross that boundary, they become black hackers.

<p><font size="3px"><strong>Black Hat Hackers:-</strong>Today, anyone can become a hacker. Within that denomination, there are three types of hackers. The first one is the black hacker, also known as a cracker, someone who uses his computer knowledge in criminal activities in order to obtain personal benefits. A typical example is a person who exploits the weaknesses of the systems of a financial institution for making some money.<br>


Black hat hackers have become the iconic image of all hackers around the world. For the majority of computer users, the word hacker has become a synonym for social misfits and criminals. Of course, that is an injustice created by our own interpretation of the mass media, so it is important for us to learn what a hacker is and what a black hacker (or cracker) does. So, let's learn about black hat techniques and how they make our lives a little more difficult.

Both security threats that you have to take into account.Well, some people do, and although many of them don't want their names bandied about, as is the case with the author of this tip, they can tell us much about the shadowy hacker community.<BR>


<strong>Hackers:</strong>
A hacker is a person intensely interested in the arcane and recondite workings of any computer operating system. Hackers are most often programmers. As such, hackers obtain advanced knowledge of operating systems and programming languages. They might discover holes within systems and the reasons for such holes. Hackers constantly seek further knowledge, freely share what they have discovered, and never intentionally damage data.

<p><font size="3px"><strong>Crackers-: </strong>Crackers are the black hats. Crackers are the people who challenge the white hats. The most common method of challenging is cracking one site’s security and then either leaking the confidential information or defacing. In both the cases the webmasters face a lot of difficulties. When a cracker defaces a website, it is the job of a hacker to patch it up. Crackers are even sent to jails for doing this and some of them have even been assassinated. In the nutshell, crackers are the outlaws. When a cracker breach the security of one site, he/she uses all the possible methods to hide himself/herself, rather stay anonymous but it is the cyber science or the foolishness of the crackers which doesn’t help their cause and leads to their arrest, well, in most of the cases. Crackers generally don’t have a lot of knowledge about the security subject; some of them download tools which help them in cracking. <br>

With the increasing need for information security, business organizations which plan to adopt new technologies like IT outsourcing, virtualization, and cloud computing must be able to identify and face each security threats and come up with security architectures, policies, and processes. They must consider taking advantage of ethical hacking which is getting popular as an important security practice.<br>
According to CERT-In, the national incident response centre, a government nodal agency, at least 40 million Indians were hit by cyber crimes and the recorded loss of the same was a staggering $6 billion loss in disaster in the past 12 months.

Ethical hacking benefits were discussed aside from its role, solutions, and technical concerns. According to the report, the success and sophistication of cyber attacks can be directly traced to the funding of well-trained, highly motivated, and well organized groups of programmers by huge criminal organizations and nation states. Due to the increased threat, there is now a need for a more comprehensive assessment of a company’s security measures. It is important for the business entity to set up effective infrastructure, procedures, and security policies in order to prevent or reduce the effects of data hacking.<br>

Ethical hackers must complete a stringent set of background checks as part of the hiring process, as companies usually do not hire ex-hackers with an illegal past. Legal hackers are a self-policing group who share best practice methods to promote positive outcomes. In addition, various professional groups may also promote codes of conduct to set a standard of professional conduct. For instance, the Association of Information Technology Professionals puts forth a code of conduct that underscores the importance of ethical and legally binding treatment of all information that is viewed during ethical hacking situations.

Severe legal consequences exist for legal hackers that stray from ethical practices or otherwise ignore confidentiality<br>

Most ethical hackers have extensive on the job training and highly complex understanding of how network security is constructed. They need to be patient and meticulous in their processes and thorough in their recordkeeping. Ethical hackers remain in demand in all industries throughout the global.<br><BR>
