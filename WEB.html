A web designer is someone who is both creative and technically inclined, and uses both these attributes to build or redesign websites. The web designer has the ability to understand what is needed to make a website functional and easy to use, but at the same time make it aesthetically appealing to the user.Web design is a relatively new industry, having been created with the advent of the internet, and is gaining popularity in particular over the last ten years, as digital media has become a major part of many people's lives. Most people rely on the web for their communications, information, shopping, social life and more.

Web design is the process of creating the look, feel, and branding of a Website. This should be seen as auto body work. You are working on the exterior (front end) features of your Website. Web design includes the creation of logos, graphics, and other advanced visual elements such as FLASH.

    Web development is the programming (data processing) of your Website. This should be seen as building the engine of an automobile. Web development often refers to data driven Websites but also refers to other automated features such as mail scripts.<BR><BR>

    Web developers add the functionality to your Website. This may be a shopping cart, registration system, or any other automated tasks you might have that, in most cases, require a database. <BR><BR>

<p><font size="3px">To find someone who is superior at both is very difficult to do. In most cases, one person does the Web design while another professional does the Web development. Designers normally do not do programming and programmers normally are not graphic artists. Each requires enough work of its own. <br><br><br>

Web hosting is the service that makes your website available to be viewed by others on the Internet. A web host provides space on its server, so that other computers around the world can access your website by means of a network or modem. There are literally thousands of web hosting services available today, ranging from free services with limited options to expensive, specialized business web hosting services. Which option you choose depends primarily on how you plan to use your website and how much you want to spend.<br><br>

<strong>Type of hosting</strong>

</div> <br><br><div class="seosecondtext">

<font size="3px">
<strong>1.Free Hosting:-</strong>

Free web hosting is best suited for small sites with low traffic, like personal sites. It is not recommended for high traffic or for real business. Technical support is often limited, and technical options are few.<br>

<strong>2.Shared (Virtual) Hosting:-</strong>
SWith shared hosting, your web site gets its own domain name, and is hosted on a powerful server along with maybe 100 other web sites..<br>
<strong>3.Dedicated Hosting:-</strong>Dedicated hosting is the most expensive option. This option is best suited for large web sites with high traffic, and web sites that use special software.

<h2>DOMAIN NAME</h2>
</div><div class="mainimg2"><h3>Dec 04<br> 2015<h3></div>
<div class="mainimg"></div></div><div class="domain"><div class="sectext">



<font size="3px">

Domain names must be registered. When domain names are registered, they are added to a large domain name register. In addition, information about the web site, including the IP address, is stored on a DNS server.

DNS stands for Domain Name System. A DNS server is responsible for informing all other computers on the Internet about the domain name and the web site address.       <br><BR>

Every domain name has a suffix that indicates which top level domain (TLD) it belongs to. There are only a limited number of such domains.<br><br><br>
