<font size="3px">

Software security is an idea implemented to protect software against malicious attack and other hacker risks so that the software continues to function correctly under such potential risks. Security is necessary to provide integrity, authentication and availability and.

<br></font> 
Any compromise to integrity, authentication and availability makes a software unsecure. Software systems can be attacked to steal information, monitor content, introduce vulnerabilities and damage the behavior of software. Malware can cause DoS (denial of service) or crash the system itself. 

</div> <br><div class="seosecondtext">

<p><font size="3px">Buffer overflow, stack overflow, command injection and SQL injections are the most common attacks on the software.

Buffer and stack overflow attacks overwrite the contents of the heap or stack respectively by writing extra bytes.

Command injection can be achieved on the software code when system commands are used predominantly. New system commands are appended to existing commands by the malicious attack. Sometimes system command may stop services and cause DoS.<br>

SQL injections use malicious SQL code to retrieve or modify important information from database servers. SQL injections can be used to bypass login credentials. Sometimes SQL injections fetch important information from a database or delete all important data from a database.

<strong>COMPUTER SECURITY:-</strong>Computer security also known as cybersecurity or IT security, is security applied to computing devices such as computers and smartphones, as well as computer networks such as private and public networks, including the whole Internet.<BR>
<BR>
The field includes all five components: hardware, software, data, people, and procedures by which digital equipment, information and services are protected from unintended or unauthorized access, change or destruction, and is of growing importance due to the increasing reliance of computer systems in most societies 
</font> 
</div> <br><div class="seosecondtext">

<p><font size="3px"><strong>Why is computer security so important? </strong>Prevention of data theft such as bank account numbers, credit card information, passwords, work related documents or sheets, etc. is essential in today’s communications since many of our day to day actions depend on the security of the data paths.<BR><BR>
Data present in a computer can also be misused by unauthorized intrusions. An intruder can modify and change the program source codes and can also use your pictures or email accounts to create derogatory content such as pornographic images, fake misleading and offensive social accounts.. <br>

<font size="3px">

Network Security is the process of taking physical and software preventative measures to protect the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, malfunction, modification, destruction, or improper disclosure, thereby creating a secure platform for computers, users and programs to perform their permitted critical functions within a secure environment.<br>

The concept of defense in depth is observed as a best practice in network security, prescribing for the network to be secured in layers. These layers apply an assortment of security controls to sift out threats trying to enter the network

Information Security refers to the processes and methodologies which are designed and implemented to protect print, electronic, or any other form of confidential, private and sensitive information or data from unauthorized access, use, misuse, disclosure, destruction, modification, or disruption.

</div> <br><div class="seosecondtext">

<font size="3px">"Information security means protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. The terms information security, computer security and information assurance are frequently used interchangeably. These fields are interrelated and share the common goals of protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information; however, there are some subtle differences between them. These differences lie primarily in the approach to the subject, the methodologies used, and the areas of concentration. Information security is concerned with the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data regardless of the form the data may take: electronic, print, or other forms."<br><BR>
