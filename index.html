Every person is born with a particular potential which is unique to him. People are of different types and not all of them are brilliant students. Many work hard to get good marks, while others don't and yet manage to score well during examinations. There are also students who study hard but don't get the desired percentage. How to prepare for exams is a big question. Here are a few preparation tips to help students ace in exams.<br><br></font> <strong>Major Exam Preparation Tips</strong><br><br>
</div> <br><div class="seosecondtext">

<p><font size="3px"><strong>Take notes.</strong>This is a must! It will help you so much. Go out and buy several note pads, one for each of your major classes.<br>

<strong>Write whatever the teacher says.</strong> Whenever your teacher mentions a future assignment or a test, try not to be away that week. You don't want to miss a thing they have to say, write all the details down.<br>

<strong>Cloud-Based Education.</strong>will be the rule, not the exception. This will start simply, with better aggregation of student metrics, more efficient data sharing, and more visual assessment results.. <br>

<h2>Technology Can Change The Life</h2>
</div><div class="mainimg2"><h3>Dec 04<br> 2015<h3></div>
<div class="mainimg"></div></div><div class="technology"><div class="sectext">



<font size="3px">

In the 21st century, technology has changed the ways in which we communicate and go about our lives. Very few educators would disagree with the notion that technology has dramatically changed the teaching and learning process. With the help of some fellow teachers, here is a short list of the top  ways how technology has changed life.Technology is a central part to learning in not only many college classrooms, but also k-12 education as well. For example, a nearby school district issued thousands of laptops to students in a 1:1 implementation and test scores and graduation rates are up!<br><br></font> <strong>Adaptive computer-based</strong><br><br>
</div> <br><br><div class="seosecondtext">

<p><font size="3px"><strong>Adaptive computer-based.</strong>testing slowly begins to replace one-size-fits-all assessment of academic proficiency.<br>

<strong>Learning simulations.</strong> begin to replace direct instruction in some pilot programs.<br>
<strong>Digital literacy.</strong> begins to outpace academic literacy in some fringe classrooms.<br>

<strong>Don't destroy or throw away any past work.</strong> That could be a big mistake if you find you need them for reference later. If you have major yearly examinations, then they will be vital when you go to study. Keep old work in a separate binder or folder so you don't lose it and it doesn't take up space in your normal binder. <br>

<h2>Technology Is Helping the Fight Against Corruption</h2>

<div class="mainimg"></div></div><div class="curp"><div class="sectext">



<font size="3px">

Using technology is one of the best ways we can can deal with corruption. With the aid of technology, we can take away discretionary powers from certain individuals (which leads to corruption) and make a centralised system.<br><br>
As mentioned in other answers, computerising all governance process will help a lot. But its in the hand of Politicians and bureaucrats to do that.As a Common Man, equipped with multi mega pixel smart phones in our hands, we can do much.<br><br>
<strong>Simple Tips</strong>




</font> 
</div> <br><br><div class="seosecondtext">

<font size="3px">
1. Video Taping the conversations with govt.authorities, while they show off their ego, denying our service, failing their duty and then literally RAPING THEM by making complaint to higher authorities with CONCRETE VIDEO evidence<br>

2. Again Video taping / photo shooting all Traffic violations (with our smart phones) and Improper Sign Boads, Non working Signals and making a complaint to the Police (Traffic).<br>

3. Smart phones help a lot in fighting against the corrupt system - Violations happen every minute in all parts of the country. Just record them to make it a proof, make a complaint and strictly follow up.<br>

<h2>The Role of Technology in Early Childhood Programs</h2>
</div><div class="mainimg2"><h3>Dec 04<br> 2015<h3></div>
<div class="mainimg"></div></div><div class="child"><div class="sectext">



<font size="3px">

Technology has forever changed our world, and our children are getting their hands on technology as soon as their little hands can push a button or swipe a screen.<br>

The rise of mobile devices means children can have access to learning anywhere and at any time. There are more than 50,000 applications for education written for iOS and Android device, on every subject and for every grade level from preschool through college       <br>

However, technology is important in today's world and taking a comprehensive approach to technology education will ensure that children thrive in the modern education system and in the jobs of the future<br>
</font> <strong >They’re More Engaged</strong><br><br><br>
</div> <br><br><div class="seosecondtext">

<font size="3px">Students who are engaged in their classes due to the use of technology are no longer passive learners, but ones who have an active role in the classroom.  Children are able to make choices where to find information, how they will use it and how they will present it.  The teacher is still ever present as a coach or a facilitator who will set goals, and provide guidelines and resources, but is no longer the center of attention as a dispenser of information.
